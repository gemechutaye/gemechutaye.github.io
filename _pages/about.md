I am Gemechu, currently in my final year of undergraduate studies, pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [Jain University](https://www.jainuniversity.ac.in/) in Bengaluru, India. Originally, I was born and raised in Ethiopia. I had the great opportunity to attend a fully funded study abroad program in India through the [Study in India](https://studyinindia.gov.in/) government scholarship.

My research interests centers on Natural Language Processing (NLP), (esp. with a distinct emphasis on advancing the realms of language modeling, emotion detection, and multimodal NLP), Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Information Retrival.

<b>I am currently searching for a Master's program in Computer Science that is thesis-based, with a focus on Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence, or Machine Learning. I plan to start in fall 2024.<b>


## Research Experiance

I have actively contributed into two research papers. In the first research paper, my team and I did a comprehensive review of Artificial Intelligence-based class scheduling systems. Our main objective was to enhance and optimize the existing scheduling process in higher education by leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies. Through an in-depth analysis and evaluation of various systems, we identified key challenges and proposed innovative solutions to streamline and improve the efficiency of class scheduling. Our findings and recommendations aim to facilitate a smoother academic experience for both students and faculty members, ultimately contributing to the overall effectiveness of educational institutions.

The second project focused on developing a specialized chatbot interface, inspired by ChatGPT, to recommend music to individuals in the mental health field. The goal of this paper was to analyze various models, language systems, and neural networks used in previous research and establish a connection between mental health chatbot applications and popular music platforms such as Spotify and YouTube Music. By combining these elements, the aim was to provide an enhanced solution for individuals in need of music-based assistance within the context of mental health.

The second paper is in submission and will be indexed on Springer by May 2024. If youâ€™re interested to look at please feel free to email me at geme.t07[at]gmail.com.
