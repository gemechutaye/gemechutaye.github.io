This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

Research Interest
======
My primary research interest centers on Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a distinct emphasis on advancing the realms of language modeling, emotion detection, and multimodal NLP. I am passionate about delving into innovative methodologies that amplify language comprehension and processing capabilities, integrating diverse modalities such as text, audio, and visual information.

My pursuit involves pushing the boundaries of language technology by harnessing the power of advanced machine learning techniques and cutting-edge deep neural networks. My overarching goal is to elevate the precision and efficiency of NLP tasks, facilitating the development of applications like sentiment analysis, machine translation, and sophisticated chatbot systems.

My research journey is driven by a commitment to not only explore theoretical frameworks but to actively contribute to the practical evolution of NLP technologies across various domains. Through my work, I aspire to make meaningful strides in the field, fostering advancements that resonate with the broader landscape of language processing and communication technologies.
